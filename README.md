Code examples for my talk about "Cohesion in Modeling and Design"

## Structure
This repository is based on the 7 Levels of SMC Cohesion based on the Structure Design Paper by Wayne P. Stevens, Glenford J. Myers, Larry L. Constantine which were published in the IBM Systems Journal, 13(2):115-139, 1974.

The 7 Levels are:

1. Coincidental Cohesion
2. Logical Cohesion
3. Temporal Cohesion
4. Procedural Cohesion
5. Communicational Cohesion
6. Sequential Cohesion
7. Functional Cohesion

For each level, I have created a package with the same name two subpackages:

- 'classexample' for an example of this type of cohesion on a class level
- 'packageexample' for an example of this type of cohesion on a package level
